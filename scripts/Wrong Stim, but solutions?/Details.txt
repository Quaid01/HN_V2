Note that an incorrect stimuli was given, but most conveged. The number at the end of the .dat file tells you which iteration failed.
The other interesting thing is that in those that failed, there were certain nodes that did not move at all. Those nodes being
nodes 1,3,7,9. 1,3,7,9 and 5 were all coupled together on a separate graph, with the value of 5 given. But 95% of the time,
a proper solution was found. No clue why these didn't find one.
